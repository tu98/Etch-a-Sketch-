I followed the directions pretty closely except I don't ask the user for an input for the grid size. IMHO this actually gives the user too much choice. I thought it was annoying to have to type in a number each time I wanted to try out a new sketch game.

Instead I decided to give the user three different buttons for grid size choice. I wrote my displayGrid function to take any n to keep with the spirit of the challenge.

This led to an interesting problem. I wanted the user to choose a grid size and be able to select new sketch games without having to re-define their preferred grid. Likewise I wanted the user to be in  a sketch game, change the grid size, and not have to re-define their current game mode.

Instead of using global variables (which every resource said not to), I decided to change the index.html file with special running classes (gridRunning & gameRunning). These classes act as global variables since only the running ID's will have them and any function within script.js can access and change them. 

After that things became pretty simple. Every ID is the same name as the function it corresponds to so I can run "eval($('.gameRunning').attr('id')+'()');" to find what game mode the user is on and to run the function, and the same for the grid if you replace '.gameRunning' with '.gridRunning'.

I wanted to practice my css and html too so I tried to make it look like a website and even added tabs and social media sprites which go nowhere.
